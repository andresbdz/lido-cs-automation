# Lido Sales Context for Follow-up Email Generation

## About Lido

Lido automates document data extraction and the workflows that follow. It turns PDFs, scans, images, and emails into structured spreadsheet outputs, then validates and routes that data into downstream systems so processes run end-to-end with minimal human effort.

### Core Value Proposition
- Eliminate manual copy/paste and re-keying of documents
- Replace fragile OCR systems that break when layouts change
- Achieve high accuracy without long configuration or training cycles
- Scale document volume without hiring additional staff
- Turn document processing into an automated, repeatable workflow

### Why Customers Choose Lido
- **Fast Time to Value**: No template creation or model training required. First results in minutes, not weeks.
- **Accuracy-First**: Significantly more accurate than legacy OCR. Emphasis on getting extraction right up front.
- **Beyond "PDF to Excel"**: Extraction is only the first step. Lido also handles validation, enrichment, automation, and form filling.
- **Enterprise-Ready**: SOC 2 Type II compliant, HIPAA compliant, no training on customer data.

### Typical Use Cases
- Accounts payable and invoice processing
- Purchase orders
- Bank statements and financial reports
- Logistics documents (BOLs, shipping docs)
- Healthcare and claims documentation
- Tax and fund administration documents (e.g., K-1s)

## ROI Calculation Formula

**Manual Cost** = (documents_per_year × minutes_per_document / 60) × $30/hour

**Lido Cost** = Match documents_per_year to appropriate pricing tier

**Net Savings** = Manual Cost - Lido Cost

Example:
- 50,000 documents/year × 1 min/doc = 50,000 minutes = 833 hours
- At $30/hour = $25,000/year manual cost
- Scale plan ($3,360/year for 42,000 pages) → Net savings ~$21,640/year

### Next Steps Variations
- **High urgency** (ready to move forward): "I can send you the contract to execute, subscription link, and we will then personally onboard you."
- **Low urgency** (needs more time/testing): "What most people typically like to do at this stage is set up a follow-up call to cover next steps and go through a few more tests together. In the meantime, I can send you the contract to execute to get ahead."
