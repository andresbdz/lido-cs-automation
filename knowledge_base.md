**Q:** How do I share a Lido spreadsheet with other team members?

**A:** Only the owner of a Lido spreadsheet can share it with others. If you're not the owner and the file shows as 'shared with me', you won't be able to share it directly. However, you have two options: 1) Go to File > Make a Copy to create your own copy that you'll own, then you can share that copy with whoever you want and control their access level (can edit, can view, etc.), or 2) Have the original owner share it with the people who need access. When sharing, you can control the level of access each person has.

**Q:** How do I create a new spreadsheet in Lido?
